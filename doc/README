A typical command for extracting new documentation:

  tar xzf ../Downloads/Common/Macaulay2-1.9.1-common.tar.gz
  chmod -R g+w .

See ../.htaccess for some instructions about adding doc for new releases and removing doc for old releases.
We never just remove doc for old releases, we also mark it gone.
