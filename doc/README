A typical command for extracting new documentation:

  tar xzf ../upload/Macaulay2-1.11-common.tar.gz
  chmod -R g+w .

See ../.htaccess for some instructions about adding doc for new releases and removing doc for old releases.
We never just remove doc for old releases, we also mark it gone.

Also adjust the version numbers in Style/trailer.html manually.
