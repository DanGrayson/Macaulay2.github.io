  Red Hat Enterprise, Scientific Linux, and CentOS offer the same Linux
  environment for applications, so the Macaulay2 distributions in this
  directory should work on all of them.  The version numbers correspond this
  way: "Scientific Linux 5.3" is based on "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 update
  3".
</p>

<p>
  We have arranged for automatic installation of Macaulay 2 on Red Hat systems,
  and the method is be explained here.  Whether you install manually or
  automatically, it is a good idea first to install
  the <a href="../../../PublicKeys/">Macaulay2 public key</a>, which "rpm" will
  use to verify the integrity of the files available here.
</p>

<p>
  To install Macaulay2 automatically, you first add
  our <a href="../../../Repositories/Scientific">repository</a> to your list 
  of software repositories.  Do this by downloading the
  file <a href="Macaulay2.repo">Macaulay2.repo</a> and placing it in your
  directory <tt>/etc/yum.repos.d</tt>.  Then run 
<pre>
       yum update
       yum install Macaulay2
</pre>
</p>

<p>
  You may also install the package files manually (they all have names of the
  form <b>*.rpm</b>), but they come in pairs, one containing the architecture
  dependent files (in this directory), and one containing the architecture
  independent files and having "common" in the name.  The latter files can be
  obtained in <a href="../../Common/">Common/</a>, and the former files are
  listed here:
