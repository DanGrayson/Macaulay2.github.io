  Red Hat Enterprise, Scientific Linux, and CentOS offer the same Linux
  environment for applications, so the Macaulay2 distributions in this
  directory should work on all of them.  The version numbers correspond this
  way: "Scientific Linux 5.3" is based on "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 update
  3".
</p>

<p>
  Eventually we will arrange for automatic installation of Macaulay 2 on Red
  Hat systems, and the method will be explained here.
</p>

<p>
  For now you may install the package files manually (they all have names of
  the form <b>*.rpm</b>), but they come in pairs, one containing the
  architecture dependent files (in this directory), and one containing the
  architecture independent files and having "common" in the name.  The latter
  files can be obtained in <a href="../../Common/">Common/</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Here are sample commands for manually installing Macaulay2 from downloaded *.rpm
  files.  (Replace "1.6" by the current version number, "x86_64" by your
  architecture, and "RedHatEnterprise-4" by the issue.)
</p>

<pre>
        sudo rpm -i -v Macaulay2-1.6-common.rpm
        sudo rpm -i -v Macaulay2-1.6-x86_64-Linux-RedHatEnterprise-4.rpm
</pre>

<p>
  Here are sample commands for manually uninstalling Macaulay2.  (Replace "1.6" by
  the current version number.)
</p>

<pre>
	sudo rpm -e -v Macaulay2-1.6
	sudo rpm -e -v Macaulay2-common-1.6
</pre>
