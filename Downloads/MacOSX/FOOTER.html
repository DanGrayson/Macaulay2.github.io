<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>
  After downloading, mount the disk image by clicking on it in your browser or by double-clicking on it in a Finder window. Then drag the <tt>Macaulay2</tt>
  folder in it to somewhere else on your disk. One good location is your system
  <tt>Applications</tt> folder, at the top level on your main disk.
</p>

<h3>Getting emacs</h3>

<p>
  There are various options for getting emacs, with which <i>Macaulay2</i> can be run.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Use "emacs for Mac OS X", available
    at <a href="http://emacsformacosx.com/">http://emacsformacosx.com/</a>.
    This is a native Mac application, with support for fonts, drag and drop,
    and cut and paste.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use "aquamacs", available
    at <a href="http://aquamacs.org/">http://aquamacs.org/</a>.
    This is a native Mac application, with support for fonts, drag and drop,
    and cut and paste.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use <tt>/usr/bin/emacs</tt>: the problem with it is that it is not X aware,
    and thus must be run in a terminal window, and that is not good enough.  (Running
    it in xterm, however, will be better than running in Mac OS X Terminal.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Compile emacs yourself from the source code available
    at <a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs</a>.
    You will also need to install X11, available, for example
    at <a href="https://www.xquartz.org/">https://www.xquartz.org/</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use "homebrew" to install
    emacs: <a href="http://brew.sh/">http://brew.sh/</a>.  You will also need
    to install X11.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Set up</h3>

<p>
  Now arrange for <i>Macaulay2</i> to set up your <tt>.emacs</tt> files and your command
  shell init files so that M2 will be on the path.
</p>

<p>
  The easiest way to set up these files is to do the following in a
  Terminal window (the Terminal application is found in the <tt>Utilities</tt>
  folder inside the <tt>Applications</tt> folder.  You might want to drag this
  application to your dock too).
</p>

<p>
  First run the '<tt>setup</tt>' command in <i>Macaulay2</i> this way, replacing the 
  path <tt>/Applications/Macaulay2-1.13</tt> appropriately:
</p>
<pre>    /Applications/Macaulay2-1.13/bin/M2
          setup()  -- Type these lines inside <i>Macaulay2</i>.
                   -- Answer any questions.
          exit</pre>

<p>
  After you log out and in again, your PATH will have <i>Macaulay2</i>'s bin
  directory on it.  The '<tt>setup</tt>' routine will modify (some of) your
  shell command init files (such
  as <tt>.profile</tt>, <tt>.bashrc</tt>, <tt>.login</tt>, <tt>.cshrc</tt>),
  and your <tt>.emacs</tt> file.  The existing files are backed up first.  It
  also creates files <tt>.profile-Macaulay2</tt>, <tt>.emacs-Macaulay2</tt>,
  and <tt>.login-Macaulay2</tt> in your home directory (making no backups of
  old versions), which do the actual work, including putting <tt>M2</tt> on your
  path.
</p>

<p>
  This allows you to run <i>Macaulay2</i> by typing:
</p>
<pre>      M2</pre>
<p>
  at a terminal command line, to access the info and man pages, and to
  use the <i>Macaulay2</i> emacs interface.
</p>

</p>

<h3>Problems</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Under Mac OS X, version 10.15, "Catalina", if you can't run <i>Macaulay2</i>, or you find that your browser doesn't open the HTML documentation
    pages, then run the following command, after replacing 1.16 by the current version:
    <pre>        xattr -rc /Applications/Macaulay2-1.16</pre>
    or this one:
    <pre>        xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Macaulay2-1.16</pre>
  </li>
</ul>
