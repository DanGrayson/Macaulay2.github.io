<h3>Downloading a disk image</h3>

<p>
  To determine which downloadable disk image to download, you need to know:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>which version of MacOS you are running (10.4, 10.5, or 10.6)</li>
  <li>which architecture your machine is (powerpc, i386 (Intel Core Duo), or x86_64 (Intel Core 2 Duo))</li>
</ul>

<p>
  You can find that information by choosing "About this Mac" under the
  Apple menu.  The disk images for 10.4 should work on 10.5, but the
  versions for 10.5 do not work on 10.4!  The disk images for 10.5 should work on 10.6.
</p>

<p>
  Here are the downloadable disk images and their corresponding signature files (see <a href="../../PublicKeys/">PublicKeys</a>);
  the name of the file incorporates the architecture and Mac OS version number,
  as explained above.
