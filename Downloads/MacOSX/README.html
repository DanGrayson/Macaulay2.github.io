<h3>Downloading a disk image</h3>

<p>
  To determine which downloadable disk image to download, you need to know:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>which version of MacOS you are running (e.g., 10.10)</li>
  <li>which architecture your machine is (e.g., x86_64)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  You can find that information by choosing "About this Mac" under the
  Apple menu.
</p>

<p>
  Here are the downloadable disk images and their corresponding signature files (see <a href="../../PublicKeys/">PublicKeys</a>);
  the name of the file incorporates the architecture and Mac OS version number,
  as explained above.
